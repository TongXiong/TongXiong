### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Tong, and I am an inspired Full Stack Developer looking to start my programming career at an early age!

I've always been fascinated on how technology runs behind the scene, and how all the components stack up on each other.
My life revolves around a computer inside and out. So all of my experience were hands-on inside of my own little workshop.
